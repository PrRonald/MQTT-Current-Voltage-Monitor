# IoT Project: Embedded Systems Integration

## Overview

Welcome to this Embedded Systems Integration project! The code snippet you're viewing represents a portion of an IoT project developed for managing various embedded systems, particularly focusing on interfacing with sensors, actuators, and MQTT-based communication.

## Project Details

This project encompasses several functionalities:

- **Library Inclusions**: The code includes essential libraries and dependencies for ESP32 development, covering functionalities like ADC (Analog-to-Digital Conversion), GPIO handling, ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework), and MQTT client setup.

- **Device Configuration**: Configurations for various GPIO pins and ADC channels are set to interface with external devices like LEDs, MOSFETs, relays, and sensors.

- **MQTT Communication**: The code integrates an MQTT client for communication with an MQTT broker ("test.mosquitto.org") over the network. It handles MQTT events, subscriptions, and publications.

- **Tasks Execution**: Two tasks, namely `Task1` and `Sendvalue`, manage functionalities related to MQTT data publication and handling sensor data.

## Key Features
